# CV

Personal CV made programmatically with React.

## Why?

Since I don't know how to use Figma to do anything, I made this project.

## How?

- I used [react-pdf](https://react-pdf.org/) to handle the PDF generation.
- Because I need my CV on other devices like mobile and I don't like to do it myself, I had to upload it on Google Drive via [their API](https://www.npmjs.com/package/googleapis).
- Finally, I wanted some kind of CMS to not store the data inside the files, so I chose [Notion](https://developers.notion.com/reference/intro) for its ease.
